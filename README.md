## Identity and Access Management
### IAM Policies

> Control what this user can do in AWS.

IAM policies can be assigned to IAM users, groups and roles.

Sample IAM policy for allowing PUT object action on Amazon S3 bucket:

```
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
> **Note:** IAM policy has three main parts: Action, Effect and Resource. An IAM policy DOESN'T have principal.

### IAM Roles
- Global service
- Use IAM Roles instead of using AWS access and private key to access AWS services programmatically (using CLI, API, etc.)
  - E.g. Attach an IAM role to EC2 instance that allows admin access to S3. Then, when you SSH into this EC2 instance, you can run AWS CLI commands like `aws s3 ls` from this EC2 instance without needing to configure AWS CLI with the AWS access key and private key(
- IAM Role can be attached to a running EC2 instance too now

## Simple Storage Service
- Object based storage (0TB to 5TB file sizes)
- Unlimited Storage
- All objects(files) are stored in buckets and bucket namespaces have to be unique universally.
- S3 Bucket Format: `https://s3-<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>`

### S3 Usage Patterns (When to use S3)
1. Store and distribute static web content and media
2. Host entire static web sites
3. Data store for computation and large scale analytics
4. Use as a highly durable, scalable, and secure solution for backup and archiving of critical data

### When NOT to use S3:
1. As a file system
    - Use AWS EFS instead
2. Strucured data with queries
    - Use RDS, DynamoDB or Amazon CloudSearch
3. Rapidly/Frequently Changing Data
    - Use RDS, DynamoDB, EFS or Amazon CloudSearch
4. Archival
    - Use Amazon Glacier
5. Dynamic Website Hosting
    - Use EC2 or EFS
  
### S3 Cost Model
Amazon S3 Standard has three pricing components: 
* storage (per GB per month) 
* data transfer in or out (per GB per month)
* requests (per thousand requests per month)

### S3 Storage Classes
1. **S3 Standard:** 99.99% availability, 99.999999999% durability, can sustain loss of 2 AZs concurrently
2. **S3 Infrequently Accessed (S3-IA):** For data less frequently accessed, but needs faster retrieval when required. Charged for retrieval fee.
3. **S3 Infrequently Accessed One Zone (S3 One zone-IA):** S3-IA with no redundancy as it spans in only one AZ.
4. **Glacier:** For data archival. Typical retrieval time will be 3-5 hours.
5. ~~**Reduced Redundancy Storage (S3 RRS)~~(Deprecated. Use S3 One zone- IA instead):** Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) is an Amazon S3 storage option that enables customers to store noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3â€™s standard storage. Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year. Designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.

### S3 Data Consistency Model
**Read-after-write** for HTTP `GET`/`LIST` operation after object is written(`PUT`) to S3 bucket successfully. However, if HTTP `GET`/`HEAD` request is made before object is written to S3 bucket, then S3 ensures **eventually consistent data model for read-after-write**.

**Eventual consistency** also applies to **overwrite** `PUT`s and `DELETE`s in all regions. This is due to S3's high availability (replication) takes some time to propogate the PUT/DELETE overwrite across all AZs.

### Interfaces
1. **AWS Console:**
Max file size that can be uploaded to S3 from AWS console is **78 GB**
2. **AWS CLI** commands/scripts
3. **AWS SDKs and REST API calls**
4. **AWS Services:**
  - AWS Direct Connect
  - AWS Storage Gateway
  - Amazon Kenesis Data Firehose
  - Amazon Kenesis Video Streams
  - Amazon Kenesis Data Streams
  - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - AWS Snowball
  - AWS Snowball Edge
  - AWS Snowmobile
  - Third Party Connectors

### Data Access: REST APIs to access buckets and objects
  - **Path-style URL:** E.g `http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/mybucket/image01.jpg`
  > **NOTE:** For US East (N. Viriginia) region, the URL will be different. E.g. `http://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/image01.jpg`
  
  - **Virtual-hosted-style URL:** These are more user friendly as they starts with bucket name E.g. `http://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/image01.jpg`
  
  **Using custom domain names to access S3 bucket:**
  - **HTTP-based URL:** Match bucket name to DNS registry name. E.g. `http://www.example.com/device.html` 
  - **HTTPS-based URL:** DON'T use *periods* in bucket name as it will NOT work with SSL due to SSL certificate exceptions. To avoid this issue- Write your own SSL certificate verification rule **OR** use HTTP-based virtual-hosted-URLs **OR** use path-style URLs **OR** use  `Amazon CloudFront` in conjunction with S3.

> S3 uses DNS for routing requests.


### Handling Routing errors:
> If a request to S3 is incorrectly routed to incorrect AWS region, S3 sends temporary redirect. **Ensure to implement retry logic in you requester application for redirect response codes**.

> If a request to S3 is mal-formed, S3 sends **permanent redirect** and responds with 4XX bad request error code. Fix the request to resolve this issue.

### Operations on Objects
1. `PUT`
* Single Part- Use for objects of size <= 5GB. **Recommended for objects less than 100 MBs.**
* Multi part- Use for objects of size > 5GB and <= 5TB. **Recommended for objects greater than 100 MBs.** Ensure aborting or completing incomplete mult-part PUTs. There is an option in Lifecycle Management section in AWS console to automatically do this.

2. `COPY`
    Copy objects within S3, rename objects by creating copy and deleting the original, update metadata of object or move objects across S3 locations.

3. `GET`
    Retrieve full object or in multi-part by using **Range GET*

4. `DELETE`
    Delete single or multiple objects with one DELETE. If versioning is disabled, DELETE will permanently deteles the object. If versioning is enabled, S3 can delete object version permanently or insert delete marker. If DETELE request only contains the key name, S3 will insert delete marker and this becomes current version of the object. If you try to GET a object that has delete marker, S3 will respond with 404 NOT FOUND error.

To recover the object, remove delete marker from current version of the object. Delete a specific version of the object by specifying object key and version ID.

To delete the object completly, you MUST detele each individual version.

### Pre-signed URLs
These are used to provide access(PUT/GET) to users/applications who do not have AWS credentials and still not exposing the S3 buckets publicly. These URLs can be programmatically generated using Java/.Net AWS SDK or AWS CLI.

**A pre-signed URL has:** security credentials, bucket name, object key, HTTP method and expiration date-time.

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
CORS can be configured using a XML config file that can contain 100 CORS rules.Use AWS SDK to apply CORS configuration to S3 bucket. CORS configration is used to allow access to S3 objects from an application hosted in different domain.

### S3 Bucket Access
#### Bucket Policies

> Control who can access this bucket.
- Use to make entire bucket public
- Bucket Policies are similar to IAM policy but are applied to AWS resources (S3 in this case). Hence it will also have *principal* defined in the policy as opposed to IAM policies. 
- Bucket policies can also have *conditions*. Condition values can be date, time, ARN of requester, IP of requester, user name, user id and user agent. S3 policy also support conditions using `object tags`.
- Can be used to put size limit policies (upto 20KBs) on S3 buckets/objects.
- Sample bucket policy:

```
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "aws:arn:iam::123456789012:user/john",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Bucket policies can be applied to S3 buckets and objects. They CANNOT be used to control access to S3's Management Functions.
- Bucket policy simulator: https://policysim.aws.amazon.com
- Policy Elements:
    * **NotPrincipal:**
        * Denies all except the principal defined in NotPrincipal
        * AWS recommends to not to use it in policy with `Effect=Allow`
        * The order in which AWS evaluates principals makes a difference with `Effect=Deny`
        * Always also provide the AWS account number along with the user ARN which you want to exempt from `deny` policy. If only user ARN is provided in NotPrincipal, then AWS will restrict access to all the users in all those AWS accounts which coontain a user with the given user ARN.
        
    * **NotAction:**
        * `Allow` or `Deny` all actions except one listed with `NotAction`
        * If used with `Deny`, it will not explicitly allow access to all the other actions not listed with `NotAction`
        * If used with `Allow`, it will explicitly allow access to all actions except the one listed with `NotAction`
    * **NotResouce:**
        * `Allow` or `Deny` all resources except one listed with `NotResource`

- Cross-Account Access:
  * **Problem:** Let's say,Person `X` is owner of Bucket `XBucket` created in `Account A`. Person `Y`(from AWS `Account B`) has been allowed access to `PUT` objects in `XBucket` via a bucket policy. When `Y` PUTs an object in `XBucket`, `Y` becomes owner of the object. When `X` tries to `GET` this object, he will be denied access to it even if `X` is the owner of the `XBucket`.
  * **Solution:** Add a `condition` in bucket policy to `allow` full access to bucket owner using `bucket-owner-full-control` when Account B uploads object to `XBucket`. With this, if `PUT` does not grant `bucket-owner-full-control`, the upload will fail.

- Multiple Policy Evaluation: AWS evaluates all policies applied as **OR**. You can define all policies in one policy or in multiple policies. Policies can be attached to a group or to IAM user.

- Access Control Lists: 
  - You may not need IAM policies if ACL are sufficient to control access to buckets.
  - The bucket policy applies only to objects that are owned by the bucket owner. If your bucket contains objects that aren't owned by the bucket owner, public READ permission on those objects should be granted using the object access control list (ACL).
  
- Predefined Groups:
  - Authenticated Users Group: Represents all AWS accounts **worldwide** and not only authenticated users from your AWS account. **USE WITH CAUTION**
  - All Users Group: Open access to all. Requests can be made by authenticated users or anonymous. **USE WITH CAUTION**
  - Log Delivery Group: Use WRITE permission to this group to allow writing server access logs.

> **NOTE:** Use VPC endpoint for secured connection between EC2 instances and S3. Using VPC endpoint, the traffic from EC2 to S3 bucket will not be directed via internet, making it more secured. You can control access to S3 via VPC endpoint by applying VPC endpoint policies OR using bucket policies. VPC endpoint policy is a `resource policy` which means it needs `principal` to be specified.

### Encryption
#### Data At Rest
##### Server Side Encryption
- **AWS provided keys (SSE-S3)**
  - Every object is encrypted with a unique key using `AES-256` encryption standard. Each unique key is encrypted with a regularly rotating master key
  - Enable `Default Encryption` on bucket to enable encryption or use a bucket policy to enable encryption on all the objects stored in a bucket. The `x-amz-server-side-encryption` can be used in bucket policy to `deny` upload to the bucket if the request does not contain `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` request header. In case of using REST API POST method, `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` should be passed as form field and not in request header.
  - We can't enforce SSE-S3 with presigned URLs
  
- **AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS)**
  - Uses a per object key which in turn is encrypted using a rotating customer master key (CMK). Master keys stored in AWS KMS, known as customer master keys (CMKs).
  - This scheme is called [Envelope Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping)
  - When you use a SSE-KMS for the first time, it will create a CMK automatically. You can create your own CMK as well. Creating a CMK yourself can provide some flexibility to: create, rotate, disable, define access control and audit.
  - Access to KMS keys can be controlled by AWS IAM
  - **NOTE:** There is a restriction on number of requests per second based on the operations. Check the [limits here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html)
  
- **Customer provided keys (SSE-C)**
  - Amazon S3 does not store your encryption key. You have to manage your encryption keys

##### Default Encryption
It can be either AES-256 or AWS-KMS or None. Any new object will be encrypted with the chosen default encryption.

##### Client Side Encryption
- Encrypt data before uploading to S3. There are two options available:
  - Use AWS KMS-Managed customer master key
  - Use client-side master key
  
#### Data In Transit
- Using SSL/TLS

### Security
- By default, all S3 buckets are PRIVATE
- Available security options can be through-
  - Bucket Policies
  - Access Control Lists (ACL)
- [AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
  - Monitors and records S3 configurations. Notifies when config is not compliant to internal guidelines
  - Auditing and SNS notifications
  - Built-in rules:
    - s3-bucket-logging-enabled
    - s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited
    - s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
    - s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only
    - s3-bucket-versioning-enabled
  - Custom rules  
- [API Logging with AWS Cloudtrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudtrail-logging.html)
- AWS Inventory to review bucket permissions
- **AWS Trusted Advisor** to inspect AWS bucket permissions, bucket logging, bucket versioning. Free if business or enterprise support is enabled on your AWS account.
- [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/): Machine learning based service to determine PII, PHI, PCI, etc. data in AWS.

### Bucket Options
1. **Versioning:** Recycle-bean like feature
  - Delete the *Delete Marker* to restore the deleted versioned object
  - **Suspend Versioning:** 
    - `PUT`: If a new version of an object is uploaded, then if that object had any previous versions, a new version of the object will be uploaded with `Null` version ID with old versions intact. If, the object had no previous versions, a new version of the object will be uploaded with `Null` version ID.
    - `DELETE`: If an object had multiple existing versions, `DELETE` operation will create a Detele Marker. When you delete the Detele Marker, it will delete the marker but all previous versions of the object will be retained. If an object had no existing versions, `DELETE` operation will create a Detele Marker. When you delete the Delete Marker, it will delete the marker and the object's version too. 
    
2. **Server Access Logging:**
- Server access logs contain the following:
  - Requester
  - Bucket Name
  - Request Time
  - Request Action
  - Response Status
  - Error Code
- Logs are written to another S3 Bucket or the same bucket on which the Server Access Logging is enabled. Ensure that the destination bucket has right permissions to allow writing logs to it.

3. **Object-level Logging:**
- Using CloudTrail Logging
- Know *Who, When and What* about the requests at the objects and buckets level
> **Recommendation:** If you enable object access logging on all the S3 buckets in your account then choose the destination bucket to use for logging in another AWS account.

4. **Static Website Hosting:** [More Details Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html)
- No additional service is required to host static website (client-side scripting is supported but NOT server side scripting)
- Format 1: `<bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-Region>.amazonaws.com`
- Format 2: `<bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-Region>.amazonaws.com`

5. **Default Encryption**

### Managing Storage
- Lifecycle Configuration Rules can be used for Automatic Transition to S3 storage tier.
- S3 Standard to others:
  - objects < 128 KB cannot be transitioned
  - objects must be stored for more than 30 days
- S3 Stardard IA to S3 One-zone IA or Glacier:
  - objects must be stored for more than 30 days
- S3 One-zone IA to Glacier
- S3 Glacier
  - This is one way transition
- S3 Inventory: S3 object metadata can be expoerted as CSV or ORC file. Inventory is cheaper than REST APIs for S3 to generate report of S3 objects.
- Two actions that can be used in a lifecycle policy:
  - Expiration
  - Transition
- Tags
- Events
- Versioning
- Requester Pays
- Server Access Logging
- Default Encryption
- Object Level Logging
- Static Websites
- Transfer Acceleration
- Cross Region Replication(CRR): Can be needed for-
  - Compliance
  - Reduce Latency
  - Operational
  - Data Protection
  - CRR Requirements:
    - Versioning enabled on source and destination buckets
    - Buckets must be in different regions
    - IAM role is configured for CRR
  - CRR does not replicate:
    - bucket lifecycle configuration policies
    - objects in source bucket before the replication config was added
    - objects in source bucket for which the bucket owner does not have permissions for
    - objects in source bucket that are already replicated 
    - SEC-C encrypted objects
  - Ownership Overwrite: Owner of the destination bucket becomes the owner of object after it is replicated
  - Use **Storage Class Analysis** to analyze storage access patterns to use the right storage classes
  - Use **Amazon QuickSight** for storage class analysis
  - Use **Cloudwatch Metrics** for S3:
    - Storage Metrics (does not incur additional costs)
      - BucketSizeBytes
      - NumberOfObjects
    - There are also a number of Request Metrics available. This incurs additional cost.
      - HTTP Operations (GET, POST...)
      - HTTP Error Codes (500, 404...)
      - Total Latency
      - Bytes Uploaded/Bytes Downloaded
    - Cloudwatch Logs integrated with Cloudtrail

### Performance Optimization
  - **S3 Transfer Acceleration:** For uoloads over long distances. [Speed Comparator Online](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html).
    - Uses Global Edge Locations
    - Uses Amazon Backbone for most of the data transfer
    - Additional charges may apply
  - **Multipart upload API:** FOr uploading large objects
  - **Range GETs:** `GET` performance optimization with CloudFront
  - **S3 Inventory:** For optimizing *list objects and their meta-data* operation instead of using list API
  - **Request Rate Performance(on a single partition):**
    - 3500 `PUT/POST/DELETE` combined requests per second
    - 5500 `GET` requests per second
    - Amazon *automatically* uses multiple partitions if the no. of requests exceed the above limits to avoid seeing `HTTP 500` error codes. You can also do pre-partitioning of data (work with AWS Support)
  - **Parallalization:**
     - Parallal uploads
     - Multiplart uploads (consider this when oject size exceeds 100MB)
     - Multipart downloads (`TransferManager` class of S3 Java SDK)
  - **Amazon S3 Select:** Retrieve only a subset of data based on a SQL expression
    - Lesser data --> Lesser Cost (Pay-as-you-go)
    - Available as API (Like `GET` requests)
    - Used with- AWS Tools and SDKS, AWS CLI and AWS S3 Console (S3 console data access limits to 40 MB)
  - **Amazon CloudFront**
    - TTL (Time-to-live) cache on edge locations
    - Edge Locations are different than AZ and regions
    - You can delete the objects cached in CloudFront, but it will be charged.

## Storage Gateway
- Provides way to access AWS storage infrastructure from on-premises software appliances
- A virtual appliance (available to download virtual machine image) installed on the on-premises as hypervisor 
- Propogates data from your on-premises data center to S3/Glaciar
- Types of storage gateway:
  - **File Gateway (NFS)**
    - For storing flat files only
  - **Volumes Gateway** (iSCSI- block based storage like a virtual hard disk)
    - This is block storage (can be used for OS, applications, etc.), It has two types:
      - Stored Volumes:
        - Data is stored locally (on-prem hard disks) and then backed up into S3 in the form of Amazon EBS (incremental) snapshots asynchronously
        - 1GB to 16TB in size for stored volumes
        - Needs more storage capacity on-prem
      - Cached Volumes:
        - S3 is primary data storage and frequently accessed data is cached locally in your storage gateway providing low-latency access to frequently accessed data from on-prem
        - You can create storage volumes from 1GB to 32TB and attach them as iSCSI devices from on-prem app servers
        - Needs less storage capacity on-prem compared to Stored Volumes
  - **Tape Gateway (Virtual Tape Library- VTL)** - Backup/archival using virtual tapes
    - Cost-effective durable solution for archiving data in AWS

## Snowball
- **Snowball**
  - Petabyte scale data transport hardware appliance to move data in/out from AWS
  - 80TB snowball in all regions and 50TB snowballs in US regions
  - tamper resistant, AES-256 encrypted, full chain of custody
- **Snowball Edge**
  - Snowball like but with 100TB data transfer and on-board storage and compute capability
  - Like small AWS data-center
- **Snowmobile**
  - A shipping container on a truck for 100 Peta Bytes scale data transport for hexabyte-scale data tranfer
- Import and export to/from S3

## Elastic Compute Cloud
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides 4 Pricing Options:
1. **On Demand Instances**
  - Pay per hour of usage without commitment
  - Good for unpredictable load
2. **Reserved Instances**
  - Term: 1 or 3 years contract
  - Purchase Options: No Upfront, Partial Upfront or All Upfront
  - Offering Class: Standard(Up to 75% off on-demand), Convertible(Up to 54% off on-demand)
  - Scheduled RIs
  - Good for predictable loads
3. **Spot Instances**
  - Bid on the price
  - Good for apps that are flexible with start and end times
4. **Dedicated Hosts**
  - Physical servers dedicated for you
  - Use your software licenses on these servers hosted in AWS
  - Good for regulatory requirements which may not support multi-tenancy
- Termination Protection is turned off by default
- Default delete action for EBS-backed EC2 instance termination is that the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS-backed Root Volumes can be encrypted using AWS API, console or using third party tool like bit locker
- Instance store volumes are ephemeral. That is they are deleted when the associated instance is terminated or there is a failure in the underlying host. Instance store volumes cannot be stopped
- EBS backed instances can be stopped. That is, you will not loose data on this instance if it is stopped.
- You can reboot both volume types without loosing the data on reboot
- By degfault, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume
- When you launch an instance, the root device volume contains the image used to boot the instance. When Amazon EC2 was introduced, all AMIs were backed by Amazon EC2 instance store, which means the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.
- Get Instance Meta-data: CURL URL: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- Get Instance User Data: CURL URL: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/`

- **EC2 Placement Groups:**
You can launch or start instances in a placement group (to achieve high throughput and low latency), which determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware. When you create a placement group, you specify one of the following strategies for the group:
  - **Cluster** â€“ clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone
  - **Partition** â€“ spreads instances across logical partitions, ensuring that instances in one partition do not share underlying hardware with instances in other partitions
  - **Spread** â€“ spreads instances across underlying hardware. Can spread across multiple AZs.
- There is no charge for creating a placement group
- Notes: 
  - Can't move existing instance into a placement group
  - Can't merge placement groups
  - Not all instance types can be launched in a placement group
  - Name of a placement group must be unique in an AWS account
  

## Autoscaling

## Elastic Block Storage
- Think of Elastic Block Storage (EBS) as a virtual disk in AWS cloud. EBS is attached to an EC2 instance.
- EBS Volume Types:
  - General Purpose SSD(GP2)
    - Up to 10000 IOPs
  - Provisioned IOPS SSD(IO1)
    - More than 10000 IOPS upto 25000 IOPS per EBS volume
  - Throughput Optimized HDD(ST1)
    - Can't be a bootable volume
  - Magnetic:
    - Cold HDD (SC1)
      - Lowest Cost HDD volume. Good for less frequently accessed workloads
      - Can't be a bootable volume
      - Can be used as file server
    - Magnetic (Standard): Previous Generation but still can be used.
      - Can be a boot volume
    - Throuhput Optimized HDD: Low cost HDD. Good for frequently accessed, throughput-intesive workloads
    
- There are many EC2 instance types otimized for specific kind of work loads (e.g. memory optimized, IO optimized, CPU optimized, etc.)
- 1 EBS volume cannot be mounted to multiple EC2 instances.(use [EFS](#elastic-file-service) instead as an EFS mounted volume can be shared by multiple EC2 instances)
- Snapshots are copies of EBS volumes taken at a given point of time. Volumes exist on EBS and snapshots exist on S3
- Snapshots are incremental
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted automatically
- Encrypted snapshots cannot be shared
- The EC2 instance should be terminated before you can take snapshot of the EBS Root volumes attached to it

## Elastic Load Balancer
- Three types of Elastic Load Balancers(ELBs):
1. **Application Load Balancer(ALB):** 
  - Works on request level (Application Layer of Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) network model). Handles HTTP/HTTPS traffic optimally.
  - Needs that Security Groups are configured to allow specific traffic to the ALB. You cab use existing SG or create a new SG.
  - **Target Types** can be- 1. **Instance** 2. **IP** or 3. **Lambda Function**
    - Health checks will count as a request for your Lambda function. This means that it will impact cost of lambda function.
  - Health Check Path should be a valid URI(must start with `/`) that points to a resource which exists in the web app e.g. `/index.html` or `/healthcheck.html`

2. **Network Load Balancer(NLB):** 
  - Works on Network Level of OSI model. Handles millions of TCP requests per second securely(TLS) with ultra-high performance.
  - Does not need Security Groups configuration to allow traffic to the NLB itself.
    - The security groups for your instances must allow traffic from the VPC CIDR on the health check port
  - **Target Types** can be- 1. **Instance** or 2. **IP**  
  - Health Check is not a path but it is the port on which traffic is allowed on NLB or can be a different port
  - You may also add one Elastic IP per Availability Zone if you wish to have specific addresses for your load balancer.

3. **Classic Load Balancer(usually referred as ELB):** 
  - For both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP. Choose a Classic Load Balancer when you have an existing application running in the EC2-Classic network.

- For internet-facing load balancers, the IPv4 addresses of the nodes are assigned by AWS. For internal load balancers, the IPv4 addresses are assigned from the subnet CIDR.
- You must select at least two Subnets in different Availability Zones to provide higher availability for your load balancer
- ELBs are always resolved with DNS name as they don't have pre-defined IPv4 addresses
- If you want to point a domain name like `www.example.com` to an ELB(which itself can only be accessed using its DNS), you need to use Route53's Alias Record

## Elastic File Service
- Supports NFS v4 protocol
- Pay for the storage used (no pre-provisioning needed)
- Scales upto petabytes
- Supports thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Read-after-write consistency model

## Lambda Functions
- A compute service without managing any server, os, etc.
- Lambdas respond to event triggers like API Gateways, SNS, other lambda functions, etc. [remember the triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html)
- Lambda Functions scale out automatically
- **Scale out means:** Each event/request/invocation of a lambda function creates 1 Lambda function instance which is independent of other lambda function instances running concurrently
- Use AWS X-ray to debug Lambda Functions

## Cloudwatch
- Standard monitoring frequency= 5 minutes
- Detailed monitoring frequencey = 1 minute (will be billed for this)
- Cloudwatch is for performance monitoring. CloutTrail is for auditing actions done on AWS
- Cloudwatch has- Dashboards, Alarms, Events and Logs

## Virtual Private Cloud And Other Services
- You can specify only one subnet per AZ

### Security Groups (SG)
  - Only `ALLOW` rules can be specified using SGs. There are no `DENY` rules.
  - All inbound traffic is blocked by default
  - All outbound traffic is allowed by default
  - Security groups are stateful. That is, if you create inbound rule to allow traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed to go back out
  - Can't use SG to block specific IPs. Use Network Access Control Lists for this purpose

## Route 53
- Domain Name Service (DNS) by AWS
- Provides DNS Types: A Records, CNAME records(Canonical Name), Alias Records
- CNAME maps one DNS to other DNS (`http://m.example.com` to `http://mobile.example.com`)
- Alias Records are same as CNAME Records with a key difference:
  - CNAME record cannot point to a naked domain name like `http://example.com`. Use Alias Record for this purpose.
- **Routing Policies:**
1. Simple Routing: One A Record with multiple IPs in it. (Randomly picks IP from the given set of IPs)
2. Weighted Routing: Set weights for different IPs. E.g 20% to a server hosted in US-EAST-1 and 80% to a server hosted in EU-WEST-1
3. Latency-based Routing: Route requests to a server IP that will have lowest latency
4. Failover Routing: Primary and Passive sites. Failover to secondary site if primary site goes down. Uses health checks to determine if primart site is down
5. Geolocation-based Routing: Figures out location of users and accordingly route the request to a server IP setup for serving that geolocation
6. Multivalue Answer Routing: Has multiple (up to 8 records) records for single DNS to IPs mapping. You can setup health checks for each of the IP. (Randomly picks from DNS records)
- Number of domains that can be managed using Route53 is 50, by default. However, this is soft limit and it can be extended by contacting AWS support

    - Supports global transaction ID (GTID) and thread pooling
    - Developed and supported by the MariaDB open source community
 - RDS never gives a public IPv4 address to a DB instance. It always provides a DNS endpoint

#### RDS Automated Backups  
  - Automated backups are enabled by default and are stored in S3. The size of S3 storage will be same as the size of the RDS instance
  - Backups are taken in a pre-defined window. Storage IO may be suspended during backups and will result in latency
  - Automated Backups will be deleted after deleting original RDS instance
  - backup retention period can be 35 days at the max
#### RDS Snapshots
  - Snapshots are user intiaited
  - Snapshots will not be deleted even after deleting original RDS instance

#### Backups/Snapshots Restore
  - A new RDS instance with new DNS endpoint will be created for the backup/snapshot restoration

#### Encryption
  - All RDS engines support data encryption at rest
  - Encrypting is done using AWS KMS
  - Enabling RDS instance encryption will also enable encryption of its autoamted backups, read replicas and snapshots for the data stored at rest
  - Existing RDS instance cannot be encrypted. To encrypt existing RDS instance, take a snapshot of it, make a copy of the snapshot and encrypt the copy

#### Multi-AZ Deployment
  - Used for Disater Recovery (DR)
  - AWS automatically reoplicates RDS instance into another AZ. Supports automatic failover to stanby replica
  - Available for all RDS engines. Aurora DB is multi-AZ by default
  - It is synchronous

  - It is asynchronous
  - Not available for SQL Server and Oracle engines. Other 4 are supported
  - Must have Automated Backups turned on to deploy Read Replicas
  - Can create Read Replicas of Read Replicas (however, it adds latency)
  - Each Read Replica will have its own DNS endpoint
  - Can have Read Replicas that have multi-AZ enabled or even in Multi-Regions
  - Read Replicas can be promoted to be their own DBs but this breaks replication

## Other Notes

### AWS services that are specific to a region
The below AWS services are specific to a AWS region. E.g. If you plan to launch AWS EC2 instances in multiple regions, you'll need to create a security group in each region:
1. Security Groups
2. IAM Keys

### AWS services that are *NOT* specific to a region
1. IAM Roles
2. [Amazon S3](#simple-storage-service)
3. Lambda functions can do things globally (e.g. access S3 buckets globally)
4. Route 53
